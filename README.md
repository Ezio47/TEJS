# TEJS
Terra Explorer JS
-----------------
A JavaScript library to make working with the Terra Explorer library easier.

This product is currently being built and not ready for primetime.

Initially, TEJS will have one main component:

SGWorld wrapper

The wrapper will have several great benefits:
 *  An easy constructor, no more <object classid="....
 *  The ability to extend SGWorld across all projects
 *  The ability to polyfill changes in the API across all projects
 *  SGWorld Intellisense for Visual Studio
